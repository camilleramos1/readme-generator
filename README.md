## Description
This project includes a README generator using node.js. I used starter code and inquirer to complete this project. The user runs the file on node locally in the users command line, and fills out the questions asked. Once all of the questions are complete, a README.md file is created called "samplereadme.md". The file is formatted correctly, and contains all sections needed to satisy the need for a professional readme. 

## Installation
To use this README generator, clone this repository from Github and download Nodejs.

## Usage
To use the generator, run the index.js file in Nodejs using your command line. Fill out each question. A README.md file will then be generated.
